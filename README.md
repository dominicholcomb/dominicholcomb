### Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

I am a statistics and physics graduate, and I'm excited for you to see my work on github!
I think some of the projects are pretty fun.

I believe success in a technincal role relies on both the ability to create useful computational tools and visualizations and the ability to comunicate them accessably. In this github, I focus on the former, demonstrating the breadth of my technical know-how with the projects you can find below.
