### Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

I am a statistics and physics graduate, with data analysis experience in diverse domains:

* conducted analysis for a gravitational-wave detection research lab (LIGO)
* created internal automation tools / dashboards at a biopharmatceutical (CSL Behring)
* and more!

I'm excited for you to see my work on github! I've had fun making these projects and hope you can enjoy looking them over, too!

I believe success in a technical role relies on both the ability to create useful computational tools and visualizations and the ability to communicate them accessibly. In this github, I focus on the former, demonstrating the breadth of my technical know-how with the projects you can find below.
